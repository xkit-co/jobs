# Senior Front-end Engineer

## About Xkit

Software is eating the world, and that software is going to be connected together. [Xkit](https://xkit.co) is helping bring that future to fruition by building tools that make it easier for developers to add integrations to their apps.

We're a small, fully remote team. We pride ourselves on being able to "punch above our weight" - our ability to build products better and faster than teams that are orders of magnitude larger. We are first principles thinkers in everything from technical design to how we run engineering processes. Everyone on the team is capable of and prefers to operate with high levels of autonomy, but we often collaborate at the design level to find the best solutions for our customers.

We focus obsessively on the holistic customer experience, trying to figure out how best we can help the customer (even when that means teaching them the best way to do it themselves rather than selling them something). We cut scope aggressively, striving to deliver only what is absolutely needed and nothing superfluous. We take delight in our customers' delights - the little things that make a product a pleasure to use - which we don't consider superfluous, but rather essential to the product experience.

We try to operate by principles rather than by processes or rules.

Examples of how these attitudes manifest in our day-to-day lives include:
- No standups: no added value for our current team size
- Ignoring code coverage: tests should make our and our customers' lives better; we're after practical bug prevention, not a magic number
- One command deploys: changing code in production should be easy to do and easy to do right

We expect all members of our team to be:
- focused: on the customer and on our overarching business goals
- skilled: highly skilled in their field; good critical thinkers and fast learners outside of it
- workers: action-oriented, finishers, willing to contribute outside their area of expertise

## About the Product

Xkit lets developers add direct, native, embedded integrations to their SaaS app as easily as building a Zapier app. With one straightforward integration to Xkit, developers can add integrations to Salesforce, HubSpot, Zendesk, and others without writing any additional code. Most of the time, those integrations can even be added by non-engineers, like product managers and customer success managers.

Unlike other products in the market, we're built from the ground up to serve the needs of developers and make sure we're a stable part of their infrastructure even as their integrations grow more complex. That's led to a few key decisions that differentiates us from the competition:
- We work with your existing API so that data flows through your application before hitting your database
- We allow for historical data sync
- New data and updates to data is on a low latency basis (<2 minutes) so your customers' data is always up to date in your app
- We expose all of the data that the APIs your integrating with offer
- We're fully white-labeled and give you direct access to the underlying API credentials (like OAuth tokens) so you can extend integrations beyond what we do

## About the Role

We're hiring a Senior Front-end Engineer to help us deliver our new project.

Our front-end stack is in Typescript with a significant portion focused on React using the [Evergreen component library](https://evergreen.segment.com). The back-end is written in Elixir and uses the Phoenix framework and a PostgreSQL database.

We have three separate front-end codebases:
- [xkit.js](https://github.com/xkit-co/xkit.js), our open source client for Xkit
- [xkit-catalog.js](https://github.com/xkit-co/xkit-catalog.js), our open source UI kit for working with Xkit, written in React
- Our [developer portal](https://app.xkit.co), written in React

This role will be responsible for extending each of those three front-end codebases to support our new integration feature. This will include expanding the functionality of our UI kit to support more interaction modes, and adding brand new flows in our developer portal to enable low-code and no-code builds of integrations.

There are currently no other full time front-end engineers on the team, so this role will be responsible for solidifying our approach to our front-end libraries and will be a critical part of building the foundation for the future of our Front-end engineering team.

### Requirements

- Native-level proficiency in spoken and written English
- 6+ years as a professional software developer
- Significant professional experience with React
- Fully remote, but able to work 11am - 1pm PT most week days


What we look for:
- Strong written and spoken communication skills
- Writes clean, easy to understand code
- Highly productive: able to ship new features and refactors quickly
- Good eye for design: we don't have a full-time designer, so this role will be responsible for a lot of the app's visual appearance, primarily by relying on [Evergreen](https://evergreen.segment.com) components
- Customer oriented: thinks through features from the customers perspective and delivers with the customer in mind

### Hiring Process

1. Submit a work resume or CV to `jobs@[our main domain]`
2. Complete a short online evaluation (~30 min)
3. Submit relevant coding samples
4. Video interview with our CEO
5. 1-2 week (paid) working trial

We rely heavily on working trials to serve as an extended interview for both you and us. We've found they are the best way for us to evaluate candidates and for candidates to judge whether the fast-paced, high autonomy startup style of working is for them.
