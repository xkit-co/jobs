# Senior Web Application Engineer

## About Xkit

Software is eating the world, and that software is going to be connected together. [Xkit](https://xkit.co) is helping bring that future to fruition by building tools that make it easier for developers to add integrations to their apps.

We're a small, fully remote team. We pride ourselves on being able to "punch above our weight" - our ability to build products better and faster than teams that are orders of magnitude larger. We are first principles thinkers in everything from technical design to how we run engineering processes. Everyone on the team is capable of and prefers to operate with high levels of autonomy, but we often collaborate at the design level to find the best solutions for our customers.

We focus obsessively on the holistic customer experience, trying to figure out how best we can help the customer (even when that means teaching them the best way to do it themselves rather than selling them something). We cut scope aggressively, striving to deliver only what is absolutely needed and nothing superfluous. We take delight in our customers' delights - the little things that make a product a pleasure to use - which we don't consider superfluous, but rather essential to the product experience.

We try to operate by principles rather than by processes or rules.

Examples of how these attitudes manifest in our day-to-day lives include:
- No standups: no added value for our current team size
- Ignoring code coverage: tests should make our and our customers' lives better; we're after practical bug prevention, not a magic number
- One command deploys: changing code in production should be easy to do and easy to do right

We expect all members of our team to be:
- focused: on the customer, on the product, and on the business
- skilled: highly skilled in their field; good critical thinkers and fast learners outside of it
- workers: action-oriented, finishers, willing to contribute outside their area of expertise

## About the Product

Xkit lets developers add direct, native, embedded integrations to their SaaS app as easily as building a Zapier app. With one straightforward integration to Xkit, developers can add integrations to Salesforce, HubSpot, Zendesk, and others without writing any additional code. Most of the time, those integrations can even be added by non-engineers, like product managers and customer success managers.

Unlike other products in the market, we're built from the ground up to serve the needs of developers and make sure we're a stable part of their infrastructure even as their integrations grow more complex. That's led to a few key decisions that differentiates us from the competition:
- We work with your existing API so that data flows through your application before hitting your database
- We allow for historical data sync
- New data and updates to data is on a low latency basis (<2 minutes) so your customers' data is always up to date in your app
- We expose all of the data that the APIs your integrating with offer
- We're fully white-labeled and give you direct access to the underlying API credentials (like OAuth tokens) so you can extend integrations beyond what we do

## About the Role

We're hiring a Senior Web Application Engineer to join our team.

Our back-end is in Elixir (using Phoenix framework) with a PostgreSQL database. It interfaces with our Typescript/React front-end through a JSON-based, REST-ish API.

This role will be responsible for continuing to add features to our web app, primarily on the back-end. Examples of features include:
- Enabling two-way sync to allow customers to push data back to integrations
- Allowing end users to customize mappings for integrations
- Adding new integrations to tools like Mailchimp, Stripe, and Pipedrive

While this role is primarily expected to contribute on the back-end, from time to time you'll also need to write and review Typescript/React code as well as Ansible and Terraform for deployment automation. We expect engineers on the team to do whatever it takes to ship, even if that means stepping a bit outside of their comfort zone and experience.

### Requirements

- Native-level proficiency in spoken and written English
- 6+ years as a professional software developer
- Fully remote, but able to meet at 9am PT once a week with \~2 hours of overlap between 9am and 2pm PT most week days

What we look for:
- Strong written and spoken communication skills
- Writes clean, easy to understand code
- Highly productive: able to ship new features and refactors quickly
- Customer oriented: thinks through features from the customers perspective and delivers with the customer in mind
- Elixir (or other BEAM language) experience is preferred


### Hiring Process

1. Submit a work resume or CV to `jobs@[our main domain]`
2. Complete a short online evaluation (~30 min)
3. Submit relevant coding samples
4. Video interview with our CEO
5. 1-2 week (paid) working trial

We rely heavily on working trials to serve as an extended interview for both you and us. We've found they are the best way for us to evaluate candidates and for candidates to judge whether the fast-paced, high autonomy startup style of working is for them.
